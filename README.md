## Discription:

This is Shopping Cart website built with react nothing special here I just like to write this `readme.md`...xD

Its basically fetching some data allowing you add/remove them in cart.

Some discount funtions etc...

### Note:

Best part is there are no library (like `react-use-cart`) used in creating cart...(i know its nothing crazy)

But IF YOU WANT TO COPY THOSE FUNTIONS YOU CAN DO THAT :)

btw I love `react-use-cart` -\_-
